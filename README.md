# ConvexHull
To compute a convex hull, one can use one of the many widely used algorithms. In this project we implemented two algorithms; one with brute force technique, the other with divide and conquer technique. For each of them, we briefly explain how it works in the next section, and at the end of the report a small comparison between the two algorithms in terms of their running time.
